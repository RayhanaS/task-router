about the task:

1- create a react app named contacts 
2- do not use react-bootstrap in this app.
3- create 6 components named :
  - Navbar.js
  - Home.js
  - Profile.js
  - Profiles.js
  - User.js
  - AboutUs.js 
===>  All this components must be functionnel components.

4- the navbar must contain :  home / Profiles / about    and a button "login" that

5 - the profiles will direct us to differents profiles.
6 - use the function map and the data file that I join to display the profile.
( surely you will use props ).
